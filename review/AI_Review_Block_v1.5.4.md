# Constella v1.5.4 — AI Review Packet (Pure Text)

## Strategic Briefing (Read First)

**Return format:** ranked Top 3 (1→2→3) + rationale + implementation considerations + partner suggestions + 30–90 day steps. ≤500 words preferred.

## Evidence Tier Legend
🧭 = Directly testable / operational

- **Penumbra Accord (🧭✨):** edge-case ethics/risk playbook for compassionate, lawful handling.  
- **Auctor Voting (🧭):** one-person-one-vote governance token (equal voice, non-transferable).

### Economic Architecture
- **Astris (🧭):** merit token for contribution (separate from Auctor).  
- **Universal Civic Floor (UCF, 🧭):** baseline supports (in-kind/credits) for inclusive participation.  
- **Open Palm Protocol (OPP, 🧭✨):** voluntary give-forward channel; cause-anchored buckets.  
- **Genesis Pool (🧭):** seed pool for initial bounties/backstops; version-scoped.

### Review & Deployment Layer
- **Research Matchmaking Engine (RME, 🧭):** parallel AI+human review cycles, matrix tracker, decision forcing.  
- **Matrix Tracker & Dashboard (🧭):** consensus scoring, partner overlap, bottleneck clustering.  
- **Pilot Cadence (🧭):** 12-week sprints; week 6 checkpoint; publish outcomes in Civic Tome.

### Project Threads (Initial)
- **Project Eden (🧭):** housing retrofits + utility reduction + comfort; MoU with host site; QR/weekly cadence.  
- **Harmony Movement (🧭✨):** universal movement/health protocols; 8–12 week cycles; safety screen; coaches.  
- **Progressive Settlement (🧭):** civic mediation & debt relief pathways with local orgs; PSL safety tiers.  
- **Resonant Biology (🧭✨):** somatic practices + HRV/breath metrics (low-risk, lab/clinic partners).  
- **Qubit Earth / Cymatic Multiverse / Moon Doctrine (🧭✨):** exploratory theory tracks—park unless tied to low-risk, testable pilots.

**Implementation considerations (common):** identity/privacy, safety tiers (PSL), insurance/waivers, municipal coordination, data hygiene, fraud/abuse detection, staff capacity.

- **Readiness:** scope clarity, partners available, timeline fit (30–90 days)  
- **Sustainability:** can continue beyond pilot with transparent funding  
- **Interoperability:** unlocks or de-risks other threads

## PART C — Research Matchmaking (theoretical experiments, if requested)

**Harmonic Overview Composite**  
[DIAGRAM PLACEHOLDER: “Harmonic Overview — atom ↔ body ↔ solar system (60% technical / 40% artistic)”]  
*Caption:* Cross-scale resonance patterns from atomic to cosmic scales. Evidence Tier: 🧭✨  
*Implementation consideration:* Cross-scale synchronization may require novel instrumentation.

### Stub 1 — Atom-as-Planet Resonance (🧭)  
**Feasibility:** Medium **Impact:** High  
- **Hypothesis:** Atomic transitions exhibit harmonic ratios analogous to Kepler-like orbital relations.  
- **Method:** High-res spectroscopy (e.g., hydrogen lines); harmonic ratio analysis.  
- **Controls:** Temp/pressure/EM fields; calibration standards.  
- **Success criteria:** Repeatable ratio patterns across datasets.  
- **Suggested partners:** **National Institute of Standards and Technology**, **CERN**, **MIT Center for Ultracold Atoms**  
- **Implementation consideration:** Spectral precision may exceed typical university labs.

### Stub 2 — Body–Cosmos Proportional Mapping (🧭✨)  
**Feasibility:** High **Impact:** Medium  
- **Hypothesis:** Skeletal segment ratios mirror cosmic orbital spacing patterns.  
- **Method:** MRI/X-ray datasets; anthropometric ratios; compare to orbital sequences.  
- **Controls:** Age/sex/height; statistical corrections.  
- **Success criteria:** Significant correlations beyond chance.  
- **Suggested partners:** **Mayo Clinic**, **Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics**, **European Space Agency**  
- **Implementation consideration:** Imaging windows vs. astronomical ephemerides logistics.

### Stub 3 — Breath–Tidal Resonance (🧭)  
**Feasibility:** High **Impact:** Medium  
- **Hypothesis:** Human breath/HRV coherences correlate with local tidal cycles.  
- **Method:** Continuous HRV + respiration; tidal/geomagnetic indices; time-series correlation.  
- **Controls:** Activity/sleep/caffeine; weather confounds.  
- **Success criteria:** Robust correlations with pre-registered analysis.  
- **Suggested partners:** **Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution**, **Scripps Institution of Oceanography**, **Stanford Sleep Medicine Center**  
- **Implementation consideration:** Coastal lab access for synchronized tidal sampling.
