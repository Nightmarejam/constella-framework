# 📜 Constella v1.5.6 — Review Bundle (Consensus Improved)

## ✅ Overall Assessment
Version **v1.5.6** reflects a clean alignment across **RME, Eden, and Harmony**, with updated success criteria, phased next steps, and clear implementation bottlenecks. Each scroll is concise, operationally scoped (12 weeks), and outputs to the **Civic Tome**, ensuring decision-forcing accountability. The improvements over v1.5.5 focus on **clarity of next steps, partner alignment, and evidence trails**, which will accelerate trust-building across civic and research partners.

## 🔍 RME — Research Matchmaking Engine
- **Strengths:** Clear role as the credibility backbone. Transparent versioned reviews, clustering, and partner overlap provide systemic value. Practical implementation notes (privacy, cadence, intake).  
- **Risks:** Reviewer recruitment cadence and capacity could be a bottleneck; requires strong templates to maintain reliability.  
- **Consensus Fit:** Strong anchor project with visible benefit for Eden and Harmony.  
- **Rating:** **1st priority** (core layer).  
- **30–90 day traction:** One Eden review cycle + leaderboard published → strong demonstration output.

## 🏡 Eden — Housing Retrofits
- **Strengths:** High feasibility, visible community benefit, clear measurable outcomes (savings/comfort). Permitting/liability risks well identified in notes.  
- **Risks:** City permit timelines could block early progress. Needs strong municipal partner buy-in.  
- **Consensus Fit:** Ideal pilot for RME’s first review cycle. Evident trust-building value.  
- **Rating:** **2nd priority** (first applied demonstration).  
- **30–90 day traction:** Early audit + PSL-1 installs create measurable energy/comfort outcomes by week 12.

## 🕊️ Harmony — Movement Protocol
- **Strengths:** Low-cost, low-risk entry into health outcomes; strong engagement tool. Implementation scoped (coach training, simple outcomes).  
- **Risks:** Insurance and liability waivers could slow down site activation. Metrics must remain lightweight.  
- **Consensus Fit:** Complementary downstream pilot. Can diversify beyond retrofit thread into community health.  
- **Rating:** **3rd priority** (valuable but after RME + Eden).  
- **30–90 day traction:** Cohort #1 outcomes published to Civic Tome → demonstrates replicability.

## 📊 Consensus Ordering (v1.5.6)
1. **RME** — Backbone for credibility and coordination  
2. **Eden** — Flagship applied pilot for community trust  
3. **Harmony** — Complementary, health-focused expansion  

***

## 🧭 Final Guidance
- **Anchor RME first** with Eden data to validate the flow (intake → reviewers → Civic Tome).  
- **Eden** is the immediate “proof of work” for civic trust; prioritize resolving permits early.  
- **Harmony** is best run in parallel only once insurance/screening templates are finalized, to avoid legal blockers.  
- By end of **week 12**, Constella will have a **triangulated public record**: (1) RME v1.5.6 summary, (2) Eden retrofit outcomes, and (3) Harmony pilot results. This bundle demonstrates credibility, feasibility, and expansion potential.

***

✅ **v1.5.6 Consensus: Ready-for-Review**  
RME anchors credibility, Eden delivers near-term proof, Harmony deepens community trust.
