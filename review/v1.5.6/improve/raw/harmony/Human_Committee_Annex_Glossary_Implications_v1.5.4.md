Constella v1.5.4 — Annex: Glossary (Plain-Language) & Implications

Legend:
🧭 = directly testable / operational  🧭✨ = testable with broader educational/metaphorical value

A) Glossary (1–line definitions)

Astris (🧭) — Contribution/merit token that rewards work; not voting power. Optional light decay to keep activity current.

Auctor (🧭) — One-person-one-vote credential for decisions; non-transferable; prevents plutocracy.

Genesis Pool (🧭) — Version-scoped seed funds/backstops for pilots; has rules for refunds/rollovers.

Universal Civic Floor / UCF (🧭) — Baseline supports (in-kind/credits) so anyone can participate.

Open Palm Protocol / OPP (🧭✨) — Voluntary, cause-anchored giving; transparent, no coercion.

Civic Tome (🧭) — Public log of decisions, pilots, metrics, and outcomes (the “institutional memory”).

Penumbra Accord (🧭✨) — Guardrails for edge cases (ethics/safety/privacy) when rules get fuzzy.

Review Matchmaking Engine / RME (🧭) — Simple, decision-forcing review cycles (AI + human) that rank pilots, surface partners, and bottlenecks.

PSL Safety Levels (🧭) — Project risk tiers (e.g., PSL-1 low-risk retrofits; PSL-2 supervised interventions; PSL-3 needs IRB/permits).

Cross-Thread Council (🧭) — Coordination pattern for dependencies and shared resources between threads.

Project Eden (🧭) — Housing retrofits pilot (audit → simple measures → published results).

Harmony Movement (🧭✨) — Low-risk movement/health routine; coaches + simple outcomes (participation, PROs, optional HRV).

Progressive Settlement (🧭) — Debt/mediation pathways with legal/financial partners; harm-reduction first.

Resonant Biology (🧭✨) — Somatic practices with measurable signals (breath/HRV); stays low risk unless IRB.

Harmonic Overview / Atom-Body-Solar (🧭✨) — Educational framework linking scales; experiments are optional and separately reviewed.

> Reviewer cue: If in doubt, prioritize 🧭 items first; treat 🧭✨ as optional value-add.

B) Implications & Future Use (by priority thread)

1) Research Matchmaking Engine (RME) — 🧭

What it unlocks: Credible sequencing of all pilots; partner discovery; transparent “why this first.”
Near-term (0–3 mo): One 12-week cycle; ranked priorities; partner overlap list; bottleneck map.
Mid-term (3–12 mo): Auto-ingest of reviews (CSV/API), basic dashboards, reproducible scoring rubric.
Long-term (12+ mo): Shared civic review standard; multi-city replication.

KPIs: # reviews per cycle, lead time to decision, partner mentions, % pilots hitting Week-6 checkpoint.
Risks: Reviewer/staff fatigue; data hygiene; process drift.
Mitigations: Fixed cadence; rotating prompts; minimal fields; publish data policy.
Typical partners: Policy lab; civic-tech nonprofit; university research office.

2) Project Eden (Housing Retrofits) — 🧭

What it unlocks: Fast, visible wins; lower utility bills; community trust.
Near-term: Baseline audit; PSL-1 measures (weather-seal, LEDs, flow fixtures, thermostat); weekly logs.
Mid-term: Add PSL-2 (smart thermostats, minor envelope work) with permits/insurance; cohort expansion.
Long-term: Retrofit playbooks; utility partnerships; revolving fund.

KPIs: kWh/therms saved; $/unit; comfort score; completion % on schedule.
Risks: Permits; insurance/waivers; contractor capacity.
Mitigations: Early MoU with city/CLT; pre-approved measure list; vetted vendors.
Typical partners: Municipal energy office; community land trust; public housing authority.

---

3) Harmony Movement — 🧭✨

What it unlocks: Inclusive health on-ramp; participant base for future studies.
Near-term: 8-week coach-led routine (2×/week); safety screen; simple outcomes (participation, PROs, optional HRV).
Mid-term: Train-the-trainer; translations; accessibility modules.
Long-term: Insurance-billable pathways with clinics; integration with parks/schools.

KPIs: Session adherence; attrition; PRO improvement; injury rate (target = near-zero).
Risks: Screening gaps; instructor variance; liability.
Mitigations: Standardized screen; coach certification; waivers/coverage.
Typical partners: University kinesiology; community clinic; YMCA.

---

4) Progressive Settlement — 🧭

What it unlocks: Stabilization; reduces downstream costs across services.
Near-term: Intake triage; harm-reduction settlements; mediation templates.
Mid-term: Data sharing (consented); court/municipal linkages; credit-union products.
Long-term: Policy playbooks; regional replication.

KPIs: Cases closed; average relief; time-to-resolution; recidivism.
Risks: Compliance; predatory actors; confidentiality.
Mitigations: Legal aid partners; strict data policy; audited workflows.
Typical partners: Legal aid; credit union/CRA bank; municipal mediation.

---

5) Resonant Biology (low-risk subset) — 🧭✨

What it unlocks: Evidence around somatic practices; bridges theory ↔ measurable signals.
Near-term: Breath/HRV protocols; transparent tier markers; pre-registration.
Mid-term: Multi-site replication; open datasets.
Long-term: Clinically relevant protocols if evidence supports.

KPIs: Adherence; HRV change; subjective calm; AE reporting.
Risks: Over-claiming; measurement noise.
Mitigations: Evidence tiering (🧭/🧭✨), pre-registered metrics, conservative claims.
Typical partners: Contemplative science lab; cardiology/HRV clinic; biomechanics lab.

C) “If you only have 60 seconds” (reviewer cheat sheet)

Read the Summary + this Annex. Rank Top 3 for the next 30–90 days.

Default to 🧭; include 🧭✨ only if it’s low risk and unlocks learning.

Give one primary partner and one implementation constraint per ranked item.

Keep it ≤ 500 words. We’ll do the heavy lifting.
