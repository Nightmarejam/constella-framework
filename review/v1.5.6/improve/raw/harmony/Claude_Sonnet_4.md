# Raw AI Review Drop — {RME|Harmony}

(paste the model’s response below)

2025-08-16 20:30:00 AI – Claude Sonnet 4 Paste v1.5.6 Research Matchmaking Engine (RME) RME serves as the credibility foundation for all other initiatives, creating transparent review processes and evidence trails that partners can trust. Without this infrastructure, Eden and Harmony risk duplicated effort and lack systematic evaluation. RME's review cycles will surface partner overlaps and bottlenecks across projects, maximizing resource efficiency. Policy lab (primary) + Civic tech nonprofit (alt 1) + University research office (alt 2) Focus on data hygiene, privacy controls, and reviewer capacity management. Establish versioned prompt templates and clear intake processes. Ensure ≤500 word output format with decisive 1→2→3 rankings. Simple CSV/TSV integration feeding response sheets. Weeks 1-2: Lock review templates, recruit 3-5 reviewers, establish cadence. Weeks 3-6: Run full cycle on Eden, generate partner/bottleneck analysis. Weeks 7-12: Tune prompts, recruit next cohort, publish v1.5.6 summary to Civic Tome. Project Eden (Housing Retrofits) High feasibility pilot with visible community impact and clear metrics (energy savings, comfort). Excellent trust-building opportunity with low implementation risk. Provides concrete deliverables that demonstrate framework value to municipal partners and community stakeholders. Municipal energy office (primary) + Community land trust (alt 1) + Policy lab (alt 2) Address municipal permits coordination as primary bottleneck. Secure insurance/liability coverage and contractor vetting. Establish utility data access protocols and coordinate scheduling with municipal office operations. Weeks 1-2: Identify host site, draft MoU, request utility data, schedule baseline audit. Weeks 3-6: Complete audit, procure PSL-1 materials, confirm permits/insurance. Weeks 7-12: Install measures, capture weekly logs, publish outcomes to Civic Tome. Harmony Movement Universal movement protocol creates broad community engagement and health on-ramp supporting future biology initiatives. Low-risk implementation with established safety protocols. Expands participation base and demonstrates framework's health/wellness capabilities to university and clinic partners. University kinesiology dept (primary) + Community clinic (alt 1) + YMCA (alt 2) Prioritize coach certification and safety screening protocols. Secure venue access and liability coverage. Implement simple outcomes tracking (participation, RPE, optional HRV) without over-engineering measurement systems. Weeks 1-2: Finalize movement routine and screening, recruit coaches, define metrics. Weeks 3-6: Train coaches, recruit 12-24 person cohort, launch 2x/week sessions. Weeks 7-12: Complete 8-week protocol, capture before/after data, publish outcomes. RME should launch first to establish review infrastructure before Eden/Harmony implementation. Eden and Harmony can run parallel after RME Week 3, with RME providing ongoing evaluation. All projects feed public outcomes to Civic Tome for transparency and partner confidence-building.
