# Harmony â€” Consensus Scroll

## One-paragraph brief

A **low-risk, 8-week** movement protocol (2Ã—/week) with safety screening and simple outcomes (**participation, RPE, optional HRV**). Public summary to the **Civic Tome**.

## Why now

Scalable wellness on-ramp that expands the participant base and demonstrates health capability with modest resource needs.

## Success criteria (12 weeks)

- **2â€“3 coaches** trained; **12â€“24** cohort recruited.  
- Safety screening completed; venue access confirmed.  
- Protocol completed; before/after outcomes recorded and published.

## Implementation notes

- Safety screening; **coach certification**; venue access.  
- Liability waivers/insurance appropriate to PSL.  
- Keep measurement **simple** to avoid overhead.

## Suggested partners

- **Primary:** University kinesiology department  
- **Alternates:** Community clinic; YMCA

## Next steps (30â€“90 days)

- **Weeks 1â€“2:** Finalize routine + screening; recruit coaches; define 3â€“5 outcomes.  
- **Weeks 3â€“6:** Train coaches; recruit cohort; launch sessions; weekly check-ins.  
- **Weeks 7â€“12:** Complete protocol; publish results; plan cohort #2.

## Interfaces

Pairs well with RMEâ€™s cadence for comparative evaluation; can operate in parallel once RME week-3 milestone is met.

## Consensus snapshot

- **Priority:** #3 (low-risk health on-ramp).  
- **Common bottlenecks:** Coach capacity; safety/insurance; venue access.
