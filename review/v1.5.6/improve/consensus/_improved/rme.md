# Research Matchmaking Engine (RME) â€” Review Scroll

## One-paragraph brief

A lightweight, transparent review engine that combines AI and human reviewers to rank pilots, surface partner overlap, and cluster bottlenecks. Outputs are versioned, decision-forcing summaries published to the Civic Tome.

## Why now

RME is the credibility layer for the framework. It reduces wasted effort, accelerates sequencing across projects, and creates a consistent evidence trail partners can trust.

## Success criteria (12 weeks)

- One full review cycle completed for **Eden** (+ optional Harmony).
- Partner-overlap and bottleneck clustering visible on the dashboard.
- Public summary (v1.5.6) published to **Civic Tome**.

## Implementation notes

- Data hygiene & privacy (minimum fields, retention, access control).
- Reviewer cadence & capacity; prompt/templates versioned.
- Clear return format (â‰¤500 words; 1â†’2â†’3 ranking; partners; 30â€“90 d steps).
- Simple intake (CSV/TSV) feeding the Responses sheet.

## Suggested partners

- Policy lab (primary)
- Civic tech nonprofit (alt 1)
- University research office (alt 2)

## Next steps (30â€“90 days)

**Weeks 1â€“2:** Lock packet & templates; recruit 3â€“5 reviewers; publish cadence and intake.  
**Weeks 3â€“6:** Run cycle centered on **Eden**; generate leaderboard/partners/bottlenecks; log to Civic Tome.  
**Weeks 7â€“12:** Tune prompts based on outcomes; recruit next cohort; publish v1.5.6 summary.
