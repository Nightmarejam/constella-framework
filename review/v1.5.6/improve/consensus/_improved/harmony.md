# Harmony Movement â€” Review Scroll

## One-paragraph brief
An 8â€“12 week universal movement protocol (2Ã—/week) with simple safety screening, trained coaches, and before/after outcomes (participation, RPE; optional HRV).

## Why now
Low-risk health on-ramp that broadens participation and can support later biology threads. Feasible within community facilities and university partnerships.

## Success criteria (12 weeks)
- Coaches trained; safety screen live; cohort of 12â€“24 recruited.
- 8-week protocol completed with weekly check-ins.
- Before/after metrics summarized in the Civic Tome.

## Implementation notes
- Safety screening & coach certification.
- Liability waivers/insurance and venue access.
- Simple outcomes capture (sheet + optional HRV).

## Suggested partners
- University kinesiology dept. (primary)
- Community clinic (alt 1)
- YMCA (alt 2)

## Next steps (30â€“90 days)
**Weeks 1â€“2:** Finalize routine & screening; recruit coaches; define metrics.  
**Weeks 3â€“6:** Train coaches; recruit cohort; run sessions; weekly logs.  
**Weeks 7â€“12:** Complete protocol; publish outcomes; scope cohort #2.
