# Eden â€” Consensus Scroll

## One-paragraph brief

A **12-week** pilot: baseline audit â†’ **PSL-1** measures (weather-seal, LEDs, flow fixtures, thermostat tuning) â†’ weekly logs â†’ public results in the **Civic Tome**.

## Why now

High-feasibility, visible community value with measurable outcomes (**kWh savings, comfort**). Trust-building with municipal & community partners and an ideal first RME demonstration.

## Success criteria (12 weeks)

- **MoU** with host site + baseline **energy audit** completed.
- **PSL-1** measures installed; weekly logs captured.
- Public **outcome summary** published to Civic Tome (metrics + photos/notes).
- Permits/insurance handled and documented.

## Implementation notes

- **Municipal permits/coordination** (primary bottleneck).
- Insurance/liability waivers; **contractor vetting**.
- Utility data access; scheduling with city offices.
- Measurement: kWh baseline vs. post; simple comfort/tenant feedback.

## Suggested partners

- **Primary:** Municipal energy office  
- **Alternates:** Community land trust; Public housing authority *(Policy lab advisory optional)*

## Next steps (30â€“90 days)

- **Weeks 1â€“2:** Identify host site; draft MoU; request utility data; schedule baseline audit.  
- **Weeks 3â€“6:** Complete audit; procure PSL-1 materials; confirm permits/insurance; lock work windows.  
- **Weeks 7â€“12:** Install measures; weekly logs; publish outcomes to Civic Tome; prep site #2 if results look good.

## Interfaces

Feeds RME with clear, testable evidence; receives reviewer feedback to refine scope and safety (PSL).

## Consensus snapshot

- **Priority:** #2 (first applied demonstration).  
- **Common bottlenecks:** Municipal coordination; energy audits; liability/insurance.  
- **Partner overlaps:** Municipal energy office; Community land trust.
