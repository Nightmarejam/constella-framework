# RME â€” Review Scroll

## One-paragraph brief
Create a lightweight, transparent **review engine** (AI + human) that sequences pilots and reveals partner overlap and bottlenecks.

## Why now
RME is the credibility layer for everything elseâ€”prevents wasted work and speeds decisions.

## Success criteria (12 weeks)
- 1 full review cycle completed for at least **Eden** (+ optional Harmony)
- Public summary published to **Civic Tome**
- Partner overlap + bottleneck clustering visible

## Implementation notes
- Data hygiene & privacy policy (minimum fields, retention, access)
- Reviewer capacity/cadence; prompt templates versioned

## Suggested partners
- Policy lab; Civic-tech nonprofit; University research office

## Review return format (â‰¤500 words)
- Top 3 across threads (1â†’2â†’3) with rationale
- Implementation considerations
- Partners (primary + alt)
- Next steps (30â€“90 days)
