<!-- ===== PROMPT ===== -->
# Constella â€” Improvement Prompt (v1.5.x)

## Inputs you will receive (below, in this order)
1) **Original Scroll (MARKDOWN)** for a single project/thread.
2) **Aggregation Snapshot (MARKDOWN)**: consensus priorities, partners, bottlenecks, and 30â€“90 day steps derived from AI/human reviews.

## Your task
Produce a **fully revised scroll** that:
- **Corrects facts** and resolves inconsistencies using the Snapshot as ground truth.
- **Reflects consensus** priority, partners, and near-term steps.
- **Keeps structure & headings** intact (same section order, same tone).
- **Adds a changelog note** at the bottom:  
  `> Updated from vX.Y.Z â†’ vX.Y.Z by consensus (date).`

## Hard constraints
- Do not remove sections; you may add small clarifying bullets.
- Prefer **concise, operational** language (decision-forcing).
- Keep any safety/ethics disclaimers intact; tighten if Snapshot flags risks.
- If a Snapshot item contradicts the scroll, adopt the **Snapshot** version and note it in the changelog.

## Output format (return ONLY Markdown)
Return **just the revised scroll** (no preface, no analysis). Start with the same `# Title` line as the original scroll.

## Quality bar
- Fit for public repo (no PII, no reviewer names/emails).
- Actionable in **30â€“90 days** (MoUs, permits, staffing, KPIs).
- Partners list: **primary + 1â€“2 alternates**, aligned with Snapshot overlaps.
