Project Eden â€” Review Scroll

One-paragraph brief

12-week pilot: baseline audit â†’ PSL-1 measures (weather-seal, LEDs, flow fixtures, thermostat tuning) â†’ weekly reporting â†’ public results. Sequenced and quality-checked through the Research Matchmaking Engine (RME) to ensure partner alignment, data hygiene, and publishable outputs.

Why now

High-feasibility, visible community value, and trust-building. Provides flagship tangible results while RME establishes review cadence and transparency.

Success criteria (12 weeks)
	â€¢	MoU signed with host site + baseline energy audit completed.
	â€¢	PSL-1 measures installed and verified.
	â€¢	Weekly logs captured in RME format; public outcome summary published in the Civic Tome.
	â€¢	Partner overlap map (from RME) confirms roles and bottlenecks addressed.

Implementation notes
	â€¢	Municipal coordination: Confirm permit needs; identify single point of contact at municipal energy office.
	â€¢	Liability & access: Signed waivers; insurance certificate on file; utility data-sharing agreement (min fields; retention limits).
	â€¢	Data hygiene: Apply RMEâ€™s privacy policy and templates; versioned checklists for audit/installation logs.
	â€¢	Reviewer capacity: Slot Eden into the first RME review cycle; set a biweekly reviewer cadence.
	â€¢	Contractors: Vet for licensing and W-9/insurance; preapprove SKU list (LEDs, weatherization kits, flow fixtures).
	â€¢	Measurement: Define pre/post metrics (kWh/therms, flow rates, indoor temp setpoints) and publishable visuals.

Suggested partners
	â€¢	Primary: Municipal energy office
	â€¢	Alternates: Community land trust; University research office

Review return format (â‰¤500 words)
	â€¢	Top 3 across threads (1â†’2â†’3) with rationale
	â€¢	Implementation considerations
	â€¢	Partners (primary + alt)
	â€¢	Next steps (30â€“90 days)
