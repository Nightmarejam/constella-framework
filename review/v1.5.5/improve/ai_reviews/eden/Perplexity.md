# Project Eden â€” Review Scroll
## One-paragraph brief
12-week pilot: baseline energy audit followed by PSL-1 measures (weather-seal, LEDs, flow fixtures, thermostat tuning). Weekly reporting is compiled into a public outcome summary (Civic Tome).  

## Why now
High feasibility, clear community visibility, and strong trust-building potential. Aligns with current consensus priorities (ranked #2 overall).  

## Success criteria (12 weeks)
- Executed baseline energy audit + signed MoU with host site  
- PSL-1 retrofit measures installed and verified  
- Weekly performance logs maintained and synthesized into a public-facing summary (Civic Tome)  

## Implementation notes
- Municipal permits and coordination agreements in place  
- Liability addressed through insurance and signed waivers; contractor vetting complete  
- Utility data access secured; establish data hygiene practices for accurate analysis  
- Link cadence with RME cycle to ensure consistency in reporting and data policy  

## Suggested partners
- **Primary:** Municipal energy office  
- **Alternates:** Community land trust; University research office  

## Review return format (â‰¤500 words)
- Top 3 across threads (1â†’2â†’3) with rationale  
- Implementation considerations with resolution of bottlenecks (data hygiene, municipal coordination, liability)  
- Partners (primary + alternates from consensus set)  
- Next steps (30â€“90 days: MoU finalization, baseline energy audit, PSL-1 retrofits underway, reporting cadence set with RME)
