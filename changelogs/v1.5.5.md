# Changelog — v1.5.5 (Unreleased)

## Added
- **Constella docs skeleton** under `docs/constella/`:
  - `overview.md`, `civic-orchestration.md`, `decisions.md`, `open-questions.md`, `structures.md`, `README.md`
  - `_inbox/constella_raw.md` (imported working notes)
- **Review infrastructure**:
  - **AI Review Package (pure text)** for GPT-5/Claude/Grok
  - **Human Committee Packet** with softer tone, rubric, and 1-page response template
  - **Matrix Tracker CSV** + consensus mini-guide (points: 3/2/1; tie-breakers by #1 votes, avg points, fewer critical blockers)
- **Scripts**:
  - `scripts/cleanup_docs.sh` (dry-run + `--write`) to normalize README links/badges and prune empty dirs
- **Review archives**:
  - `review/v1.5.3-cosmic/review_scroll.md` (living notes backfilled)
- **Release staging**:
  - `release/v1.5.5/assets/visuals/` (placeholder for diagrams)

## Changed
- Top-level `README.md` updated with current structure and quick links.
- Documentation links normalized; “doctrine” badge/link inserted where applicable.

## Fixed
- Removed accidental commit of `docs/.DS_Store`; added `.gitignore` entries for macOS artifacts.

## Notes
- GitHub branch protections flagged merge-commit + status-check warnings during earlier pushes; content landed and tree is now clean.
- v1.5.5 will primarily aggregate **review outputs** and the **Decision Summary + 30–90 day plan** for the #1 priority thread.

## Migration / Operator Notes
- Continue logging reviewer responses (AI + human) row-by-row into the Matrix Tracker.
- Use `scripts/cleanup_docs.sh --write` before tagging v1.5.5 to keep docs tidy.
