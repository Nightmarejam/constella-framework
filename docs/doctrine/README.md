# 🌌 The Celestial Equilibrium
*A Starborne Compass for Human Resonance*

This doctrine is the ethical foundation that informs the Constella Framework.  
It provides a practical, non-dogmatic lens for alignment and governance: **body · mind · world** in harmonic relationship, with **dissonance** treated as a natural signal to resolve—not an enemy to erase.

## 📚 Read the Doctrine
- **Full Text (Markdown):**  
  https://github.com/Nightmarejam/celestial-equilibrium/blob/v1.0.0/DOCTRINE.md
- **Signed PDF (Provenance Copy):**  
  https://github.com/Nightmarejam/celestial-equilibrium/blob/v1.0.0/The_Celestial_Equilibrium.pdf

> Why external links? The doctrine is tracked as a **submodule** for integrity and auditability. GitHub doesn’t reliably deep-link to files *inside* a submodule from a parent README, so we link to the canonical repo at the tagged release.

## 🔑 Core Ideas (at a glance)
- **Resonance Gap:** Misalignment between a person’s will and their world’s frequency creates friction and loss of meaning.
- **Harmonic Alignment:** Flourishing requires coherence across **body**, **mind**, and **world**.
- **Role of Dissonance:** Dissonance is natural and often creative; it becomes harmful only when **chronic and unresolved**.
- **Cycle of Restoration:** Recognize → adjust environment → build micro-resonances → embody → scale to community.
- **Human Standard:** Judge systems by how they treat those with the **weakest resonance**.
- **Oath of Resonance:** Design structures that **reduce the resonance gap** before judging performance.

## 🧭 “Religion as a Question”
The appendix reframes religion as a **keeper of questions** rather than fixed answers, offering a resonance-based perspective on:
- Purpose, death, moral action, suffering, and leadership  
(See Appendix in the full text.)
