# Pilot: Gaia / Sky — Community Resonance Mapping

**Purpose:**  
Test coordination between two civic threads — **Gaia** (earth/resources) and **Sky** (communication/mobility) — to reduce local dissonance and increase shared alignment.

**Duration:** 60 days  
**Owners:** @your-handle (Steward), @liaison (Gaia↔Sky liaison)  
**Data stub:** [`/docs/data/gaia-sky.csv`](../data/gaia-sky.csv)

## 1) Problem Statement
Which resonance/dissonance are we addressing? Who is affected? What is the baseline?

- Symptoms: e.g., food desert + limited last-mile transport
- Baseline signals: participation rate, delivery delays, ambient noise, self-reported alignment

## 2) Hypothesis (Resonance Lens)
If we tune **world (environment)** via resource exchange and **mind/body (participants)** via simple rituals, alignment will increase and dissonance markers will drop.

**Signals to watch**
- **Leading:** participation_rate, intervention_adherence  
- **Lagging:** self_reported_alignment, environmental_noise_delta

## 3) Scope (weeks 0–9)
- **Week 0–1:** Recruit 3–5 participants per thread; set roles and consent
- **Week 2–7:** Run 3 exchange cycles (2 weeks each)
- **Week 8–9:** Synthesis & public debrief

**Roles**
- Steward(s): cadence + decisions
- Liaison: cross-thread sync
- Contributors: data + interventions
- Community reps: feedback loop

**Dependencies**
- Venue or channel for swaps; opt-in consent; simple data capture

## 4) Exchange Cycle (repeat 3x)
1. Gaia publishes available resources (produce, tools, spaces)
2. Sky publishes available capacity (delivery windows, comms slots)
3. Match + schedule; run micro-interventions
4. Log outcomes; adjust next cycle

## 5) Risks & Safeguards
- Risks: data_privacy, placebo_effect, participation_fatigue  
- Safeguards: anonymization, opt-in consent, weekly check-ins  
- Ethical review: **Penumbra Accord** checklist

## 6) Governance Touchpoints
- Cadence: **Civic Orchestration** (biweekly)
- Decision logs: `civic_tome://pilots/gaia-sky`
- Closure criteria: report + public debrief

## 7) Metrics
- **Leading:** participation_rate, intervention_adherence  
- **Lagging:** self_reported_alignment (1–5), environmental_noise_delta (dB change)

## 8) Artifacts
- Data schema/stub: `/docs/data/gaia-sky.csv`  
- Templates: intake + cycle log  
- Weekly notes: brief narrative + highlights
