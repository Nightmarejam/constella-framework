## ðŸ“‹ Steps
1. **Select Site** â€“ Choose a location with open sky and minimal light pollution.
2. **Map Baseline** â€“ Record current environmental, social, and symbolic markers.
3. **Implement Adjustments** â€“ Apply minimal interventions aligned with the pilotâ€™s resonant goals (e.g., symbolic planting, reflective markers).
