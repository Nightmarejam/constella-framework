# Constella — Working Draft (v1.5.5)

> This is the **living compilation** of the Constella framework.  
> It captures vision, structures, and incremental decisions **before** they’re promoted into the public *Civic Tome*.  
> Status: **Draft**, tracked under the v1.5.5 cycle. See the [v1.5.5 Review Scroll](../v1.5.5/../v1.5.5/review_scroll.md).

## 🚀 Preface
**Purpose.** Constella is a civic R&D framework for prioritizing and piloting high-impact community projects.  
**Operating principle.** Evidence-first, decision-forcing, small pilots, transparent outcomes.  
**Two surfaces.**
- **Working Draft (this page):** evolving notes, structures, and rationales.
- **Civic Tome:** stable record of approved decisions, pilots, and outcomes.

**What’s new in v1.5.5.**  
- Review Scroll for this cycle (AI + human)  
- Genesis Pool backbone as the primary candidate for “next block”  
- Cleanup and cross-linking across docs + review

---

## 🌌 Core Metaphors (orientation)
- **Orchestration as “meta-skin / biotic field”** — light connective tissue that routes signals and resources without heavy bureaucracy.
- **Fascia ⇄ fungus analogy** — distribution and insulation; prevent “hot spots” and starvation.
- **Signal hygiene** — create quiet channels for decisions and minimum-necessary data trails.

## 🏛️ Structural Modules (v1.5.5 focus)
### 1) Genesis Pool (Backbone) — *proposed next block*
A lightweight routing layer for contributions (**fiat, time, goods, intent**) into clearly labeled project “buckets”.

**Why now (summary):**
- Unblocks small, symbolic starts while bigger partnerships land.
- Gives contributors a single, transparent on-ramp.
- Powers early outcome logging (fuel for the Civic Tome).

**Interface (v0):**
- **Inputs:** card form (amount / type / preferred bucket / public or anonymous).  
- **Routing:** ledger entries tagged by *Project*, *Purpose*, *PSL level*.  
- **Outputs:** public log with totals, spend notes, and links to pilot logs.

**Safety & governance:**  
- Minimum-necessary data; consent for public attributions.  
- Monthly reconciliation note in the Tome; ad-hoc snapshots allowed.  
- “Stop switch” (steward can pause intake per bucket).

**KPIs:** number of contributors, time-to-deployment, % routed to PSL-1 pilots, publication cadence.

### 2) Merit Ledger Protocol (outline)
- Records **who did what, when, and to what effect**, separate from voting rights.
- Feeds future recognition/bounties; avoids equating voice with spend.

### 3) Bounty Forge & Redundancy Matrix (outline)
- **Bounty Forge:** small, crisp tasks; scoped and time-boxed.  
- **Redundancy Matrix:** at least two independent implementers for critical actions; reduces single-point failures.

### 4) Optional Merit Fund (OMF) / Wellness Equity Fund (WEF) (outline)
- **OMF:** optional merit pooling for symbolic recognition.  
- **WEF:** earmarks for wellness access (e.g., coaching sessions, equipment loans).

---

## ⚖️ Abuse Mitigation (checklist)
- **Identity:** one-way hashed handles; optional proofs for stewards.  
- **Sybil/Sockpuppet:** rate-limits; contribution ceilings; review friction for suspicious bursts.  
- **Execution fraud:** require before/after evidence; signed attestations for payouts.  
- **Collusion:** random reviewer rotation; public rationale summaries; duplicate-work detection.

---

## 💡 Benefits & Equity
- **Civic Utility Credits (CUC):** receipts for in-kind contributions (non-transferable).  
- **Transparency:** every movement into/out of Genesis Pool is logged.  
- **Access:** PSL tiering (PSL-1 = lowest risk) lets us start safely and inclusively.

---

## 🔮 Long-Term Vision (pointers)
- **Proof of Intent** primitives for pledges and “soft reservations”.  
- **Cross-cultural forks** with shared minimal invariants (review cadence, PSL, ledger events).  
- **Business framework** for service arms that fund public goods.  
- **Civic constitution layer**—codify stable rules after repeated practice.

## 🧪 v1.5.5 — Active Threads (decision forcing)
**Candidate Next Block:** *Genesis Pool backbone*  
See the [Review Scroll](../v1.5.5/review_scroll.md) for dated entries and rationale.

**Shortlist in play (from v1.5.4 → now):**
- RME (review engine) — continue cadence to feed decisions.
- Project Eden — PSL-1 measures as early proof (weather-seal, LEDs, flow devices, thermostat).
- Harmony Movement — 8-week protocol; coach training; minimal metrics (participation + optional HRV).

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes (v1.5.5)
**Data hygiene:** minimum fields, clear retention, who can see what.  
**Municipal touchpoints:** early permit review; standard MoU snippets.  
**Insurance/waivers:** single-page waiver template; PSL-specific clauses.  
**Staffing:** small facilitation pool + rotating reviewers; load caps.

---

## ⏱️ 30–90 Day Plan (if Genesis Pool is selected)
**Week 1–2**  
- Build v0 intake + ledger screens (no auth beyond email OTP).  
- Draft public log table + daily snapshot.  
- Prepare Tome entry templates for monthly reconciliation.

**Week 3–6**  
- Launch 2–3 **symbolic starter threads**: *Shelter Stories*, *Fix It Forward*, *Civic Primer Kit*.  
- Route first contributions; publish weekly mini-notes.  
- Run one RME cycle specifically on “Genesis Pool + starters”.

**Week 7–12**  
- Tighten routing rules, add bucket caps, improve logs UX.  
- Publish first “impact slice” (inputs → actions → outcomes).  
- Propose promotion of stable parts to the Civic Tome.

**Dependencies:** one volunteer dev, one steward, part-time reviewer, light design support.
