# Penumbra Accord

The Penumbra Accord is Constella's restorative justice and conflict resolution framework.

## Core Flow

```
Declare Harm → Mediation → Repair Contract → Reintegration
```

## Purpose

The Penumbra Accord governs edge cases and disputes within the Constella ecosystem. It prioritizes:
- **Restorative over punitive** approaches
- **Repair** of harm rather than punishment
- **Reintegration** of participants back into the community

## Process Steps

1. **Declare Harm**: The affected party formally registers the conflict or harm
2. **Mediation**: A trained mediator facilitates dialogue between parties
3. **Repair Contract**: Parties agree on concrete steps to address the harm
4. **Reintegration**: Successful completion returns participants to full standing

## Mediator Role

Mediators are trained in:
- Restorative practice
- Trauma-aware communication

## Metrics

The Penumbra system tracks:
- Time in conflict (goal: minimize)
- Repair completion rate
- Recurrence rate (goal: minimize repeat conflicts)

## Guardrails

- **Vulnerable populations**: Extra consent steps or exclusion from certain processes
- **Immediate halt**: On any safety breach
- **IRB-lite**: Human subjects checklist for research threads
