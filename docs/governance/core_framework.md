# Constella Core Framework — Purpose & Flow (v1.0 draft)

## I. Purpose
Constella envisions civic life as a **resonant, regenerative system**.  
It is designed to:
- Provide **continuity** across generations.
- Foster **resonance** of individual contributions.
- Guarantee **dignity** through shared support.
- Prevent stagnation through **feedback and renewal**.

---

## II. Flow of the Framework
Constella’s life cycle can be read as a **sequence of flows**, each linked like harmonic steps:

1. **Genesis Pool (Origin Flow)**  
   Contributions generate *Astris* (civic merit), entering circulation.  

2. **Thread Initiation (Idea Flow)**  
   Civic ideas are bundled into *threads*, carrying clear intent.  

3. **Civic Orchestration (Decision Flow)**  
   Rotating facilitation ensures fairness; *Auctor* balances Astris with equal civic voice.  

4. **Execution & Vaults (Resource Flow)**  
   Funded threads execute; vaults safeguard pooled Astris and resources.  

5. **Civic Tome (Memory Flow)**  
   Outcomes, precedents, and lessons are recorded in the Tome.  

6. **Penumbra Accord (Shadow Flow)**  
   Ambiguities, failures, or harms are handled with restorative justice.  

7. **Feedback & Decay (Entropy Flow)**  
   Astris decay and thread sunsets prevent hoarding and ossification, making room for renewal.

## III. Pillars of the Framework
Each pillar acts as an **anchor node** in the system:

- **Civic Orchestration** — rotating facilitation, thread governance.  
- **Civic Tome** — transparent civic memory.  
- **Penumbra Accord** — compassionate edge-case resolution.  
- **Astris / Auctor** — dual-token balance: merit and equal voice.  
- **Universal Civic Floor (UCF)** — voluntary baseline dignity.  
- **Pilots (Eden, Mobility, Settlement, Gaia, Sky)** — testbeds for applied infrastructure.  

---

## IV. Harmonic Pairings
Each flow mirrors a natural metaphor:

- Genesis ↔ birth of possibility  
- Threads ↔ civic imagination  
- Orchestration ↔ collective rhythm  
- Vaults ↔ grounded resources  
- Tome ↔ memory against amnesia  
- Accord ↔ compassion in shadows  
- Decay ↔ renewal through release  

---

## V. Starting Line
Every cycle begins with:
1. **Genesis** → contribution creates Astris.  
2. **Thread formation** → intent defines direction.  
3. **Orchestration** → facilitation balances voices.  

From here, the framework unfolds into its full harmonic cycle.

## VI. Civic Vision
Constella is not a static constitution but a **living score**:  
- Each participant is a note.  
- Each thread is a melody.  
- Each cycle builds into harmony.  

Its aim: a civic system where justice, memory, and imagination resonate together, renewing themselves through time.
