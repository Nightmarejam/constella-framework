# Harmony Framework v4.0.0

*Full framework documentation for the Constella civic governance system.*

## Overview

The Harmony portion of Constella focuses on aligning personal and communal rhythms through specific practices. It uses a staged journey approach:

### Stage 1: Friction Awareness (The Body of Tension)
- **Goal:** Identify internal "dissonance" that creates imbalance
- **Practices:** Breath mapping, Resonance journaling, Gravity flow meditations
- **Civic connection:** Self-assessment before community contribution

### Stage 2: Wave Integration (The Body of Flow)  
- **Goal:** Harmonize conflicting internal patterns and align with external systems
- **Practices:** Mirror resonance, Binaural tuning, Harmonic breath
- **Civic connection:** Restorative justice (Penumbra Accord) and community healing

## Key Concepts

- **Celestial Equilibrium:** Systems succeed by harmonizing trust, dignity, and renewal
- **Resonance Governance:** Decisions judged by how they treat the "weakest resonance"
- **Phase Flip Zones:** Critical transition points in governance cycles
