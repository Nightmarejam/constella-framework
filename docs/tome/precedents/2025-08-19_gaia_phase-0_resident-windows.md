# Precedent Card — Gaia Phase 0: Resident Windows

Title: Resident windows prevent idle crews
Context: Project Gaia — Phase 0 (10-unit Tier Basic retrofits)
Pattern: Pre-schedule resident access windows before kit delivery; bundle installs by building/cluster; include a same-day reschedule buffer (1 slot) per crew.
Anti-Pattern: Ad-hoc drop-ins or open-ended install windows that leave crews idle and miss kit SLAs.
