# Constella Welcome Kit
**Audience:** Zero-context newcomer  
**Goal:** Give a clear, non-mystical entry point and a first-hour path.

---

## What is Constella?
**Constella is a civic governance framework** designed to help communities:
- make decisions without power capture,
- handle conflict without escalation spirals,
- and maintain a baseline of stability for the most vulnerable.

Constella is **not** software. It can be supported by software later, but the core deliverable is a **protocol + living doctrine**.

---

## The problem it’s solving (plain language)
Most real-world governance fails because it can’t reliably do three things at once:
1) **Make decisions that stay legitimate over time**
2) **Process conflict into repair instead of punishment**
3) **Protect vulnerable people without collapsing the system**

Constella is built as a “living civic operating framework” aimed at those three failure modes.

---

## The five core ideas
1. **Threads over arguments**  
   Work happens in visible, trackable threads with a goal, claims, evidence, and outcomes.

2. **Evidence levels**  
   Claims are graded by strength so speculation doesn’t pretend to be truth.

3. **Repair over punishment**  
   Conflict is processed into accountability + repair + reintegration (not endless exile).

4. **A baseline civic floor**  
   A community needs a stability layer so people don’t “bottom out” into chaos.

5. **Merit ≠ dominance**  
   Contribution can be recognized without creating an untouchable ruling class.

## Where Harmony fits (optional layer)
Harmony is your teaching bridge: it models how systems convert “load” into stability via a **Phase Flip** concept in the body.

Constella can use that as an *analogy* for governance:
- dissent/conflict = load
- repair/accountability = conversion zone
- stable outcomes = restored equilibrium

This layer is **optional** for newcomers. Constella stands on its own.

---

## Participation roles (pick one)
- **Learner:** read the overview + glossary and follow one sample thread end-to-end.
- **Contributor:** join a thread, add evidence, propose patches, help test pilots.
- **Builder:** create tools/docs/templates; integrate review loops (FAITHH-assisted).

---

## First 60 minutes (onboarding path)
1) Read this kit (10 min).  
2) Learn the starter glossary (10 min).  
3) Walk through a sample thread lifecycle (20 min).  
4) Choose a role + pick one “starter thread” to observe or contribute to (20 min).

---

## Thread lifecycle (simple)
1) **Problem statement**
2) **Claims** (what we think is true)
3) **Evidence** (what supports the claims)
4) **Proposal**
5) **Decision**
6) **Audit / review**
7) **Iteration** (patch the doctrine and the process)

---

## Starter glossary
- **Thread:** a workstream with a goal, claims, evidence, decisions, outcomes.
- **Evidence tier:** a label for how strong a claim is (idea → supported → verified).
- **Repair pathway:** the process that converts conflict into restoration and reintegration.
- **Civic floor:** baseline stability supports to prevent systemic collapse.
- **Merit token vs civic voice token:** recognition of contribution vs participation rights (names and mechanics can evolve, but the distinction matters).

---

## What to do next (practical)
- Create 1–3 **example threads** that are fully worked end-to-end.
- Publish a **glossary-first** doc (people learn faster with terms pinned).
- Define a pilot: small group, simple scope, measurable outcomes, short cycles.
