# Constella Framework

**Constella** is a civic operating system ‚Äî an open, merit-based framework for organizing, governing, and regenerating communities.  
It blends **practical governance**, **ethical doctrine**, and **pilot projects** into one adaptive ecosystem.

---

## üåå Overview

Constella is built around three pillars:

1. **Civic Orchestration** ‚Äì Lightweight, rotating governance threads with clear decision cadences.  
2. **Civic Tome** ‚Äì The public ledger of decisions, precedents, and pilot outcomes.  
3. **Penumbra Accord** ‚Äì The compassionate edge-case ethics and risk playbook.  

The framework integrates a living doctrine to guide long-term vision, ensure ethical resilience, and seed regenerative civic economies.
