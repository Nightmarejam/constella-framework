## HARMONY FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW (CORE MODULES)
The Harmony Framework models how the human body processes gravitational load using three modules: **Head**, **Feet**, and **Hands**. Each module contains complementary Yang (intake) and Yin (return) flows connected by a **Phase Flip**, a biomechanical transition where anterior-descending tension exchanges with posterior-ascending stabilization.  
**Head Module:** Sensory intake via eyes → vestibular → cranial vault (Yang). Stabilizing return via jaw → tongue → hyoid → C0–C1 (Yin). Phase Flip: jaw–hyoid–C1 tension exchange.  
**Feet Module:** Load acceptance via tibia → talus → arch → tripod contacts (Yang). Stabilizing return via plantar fascia → Achilles → posterior chain → occiput (Yin). Phase Flip: subtalar pronation/supination.  
**Hands Module:** Radial column (thumb + index) = Yang precision/intention. Ulnar column (ring + small finger) = Yin stabilization. Phase Flip: multiplanar midcarpal transition converting distal intent → proximal support.  
The modules connect through continuous fascial chains enabling cross-system influences (e.g., jaw → feet, hands → head). Harmony modeling is strictly biomechanical, metaphors are functional only.

## KEY DEFINITIONS
**Yang (Intake):** Forward, exploratory, load-accepting flow. Anatomical correlates: anterior lines, sensory intake, descending pathways.  
**Yin (Return):** Stabilizing, grounding, resistance-modulating flow. Anatomical correlates: posterior chain, plantar and palmar mechanoreception, ascending pathways.  
**Phase Flip:** A structural/mechanical transition point where the system reverses tension polarity.  
- Head: jaw–hyoid–C1 shift from anterior tension → posterior stabilization.  
- Feet: pronation (yield) → supination (stiffen) at subtalar–midfoot complex.  
- Hands: multiplanar stability reversal at midcarpal joint.  
**Micro-Buoyancy:** Continuous micro-adjustment at C0–C1 preventing collapse from gravitational loading.  
**Vertical Fascial Chain:** plantar fascia → Achilles → hamstrings → sacrotuberous ligament → thoracolumbar fascia → nuchal ligament → occiput.  
These definitions form the retrieval core for reasoning about Harmony modules, load distribution, and cross-system coupling.

## HEAD MODULE (JAW–HYOID–C1 SYSTEM)
Yang intake flow: eyes → vestibular apparatus → cranial vault. This establishes directional orientation and sensory weighting. Yin return flow: jaw position → tongue posture → hyoid suspension → C0–C1 micro-adjustment.  
Phase Flip occurs at the jaw–hyoid–C1 junction where anterior muscular tension yields and posterior cervical stabilizers activate. This redirects load from cranial membranes into cervical structures.  
Key mechanical points:  
- Jaw tension modulates trigeminocervical reflexes affecting suboccipital tone.  
- Tongue posture shapes hyoid position, influencing infrahyoid and anterior cervical tension.  
- Hyoid acts as floating anchor distributing forces across cervical fascia.  
- Micro-buoyancy at C0–C1 regulates global posture and vertical equilibrium.  
Perturbations in jaw, tongue, or hyoid produce predictable downstream effects in cervical alignment and, through the posterior chain, lower-limb mechanics.

## FEET MODULE (SUBTALAR–MIDFOOT SYSTEM)
Yang load flow: tibia → talus → navicular/cuneiforms → medial arch → tripod contacts (heel, 1st, 5th met heads).  
Yin return flow: mechanoreceptor-rich plantar surface → intrinsic foot musculature → plantar fascia → Achilles → posterior chain → occiput.  
Phase Flip occurs at the pronation-to-supination transition:  
- **Pronation (yield):** subtalar eversion, midfoot unlocking, increased adaptability.  
- **Supination (stiffen):** subtalar inversion, midfoot lock, rising arch height enabling propulsion.  
Windlass mechanism: hallux dorsiflexion tensions the plantar fascia, raising the arch.  
The feet act as both load absorbers and primary stabilizing sensors. Their mechanical state directly influences pelvic rotation, spinal load distribution, and cervical positioning. Subtle changes propagate rapidly due to fascial continuity and reflexive postural adjustments.

---

## HANDS MODULE (CARPAL–RADIAL–ULNAR SYSTEM)
Yang radial column: thumb + index + scaphoid + trapezium → precision, intent, fine motor control.  
Yin ulnar column: ring + small finger + triquetrum + hamate → stabilization, power grip, proximal support.  
Phase Flip: multiplanar midcarpal transition where distal finger intent converts to proximal forearm stabilization. Operates across sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes.  
The palmar aponeurosis links into forearm flexor fascia → bicipital aponeurosis → pectoral fascia → cervical fascia → cranial base.  
This gives the hands outsized influence over upper-body tension distribution, including jaw tone and ocular stabilization. Precision grip increases suboccipital tension; finger spreading reduces trapezius load. Hand mechanics also influence gait via trunk rotation and pelvic adjustments.

## CROSS-SYSTEM PREDICTIONS (VERBATIM & RETRIEVAL-READY)
1. **Anchor Claim #1:** Jaw–hyoid–C1 interventions produce measurable subtalar–midfoot changes within 2–3 gait cycles.  
2. Sustained precision grip increases jaw muscle EMG (masseter/temporalis) within 30 seconds.  
3. Precision grip alters subtalar pronation angle within 1–2 gait cycles.  
4. Tongue posture modifies center of pressure during standing (posturography).  
5. Arch compliance responds to head alignment changes (plantar pressure mapping).  
6. Windlass efficiency correlates with fascial hydration state.  
7. Grip modulation influences cervical EMG patterns; midcarpal position influences scapular rotation.

## HARMONY → AI ARCHITECTURE MAPPINGS
Harmony’s intake/return/phase-flip model maps to computational systems:  
- **Yang Intake → Attention Mechanism:** selective orientation, forward generative expansion.  
- **Yin Return → Grounding / Retrieval:** stabilizes generation by real-time correction.  
- **Phase Flip → Exploration/Consolidation Switch:** toggles between broad sampling and tightly coherent reasoning.  
- **Tongue/Hyoid → Deliberative Constraint Module:** internal modulation regulating overextension.  
- **Micro-Buoyancy → Context Window Management:** micro-refresh to prevent drift.  
- **Feet → Action-Conditioning Modules:** environment-coupled regulation.  
- **Hands → Fine-Tuning Mechanisms:** small adjustments with global impact.  

Four AI mechanisms derived from Harmony:  
1. **Output-Coherence Sensor**: monitors generation for contradictions/drift → corresponds to plantar/palmar mechanoreception.  
2. **Attention Rebalancer**: adjusts attention using coherence signal → corresponds to jaw–hyoid–C1 modulation.  
3. **Phase-Flip Controller**: exploration ↔ consolidation mode switch → subtalar pronation/supination.  
4. **Micro-Buoyancy Manager**: periodic context refresh → C0–C1 micro-oscillation analogue.

## HARMONY-AI TESTABLE PREDICTIONS
1. Models with a phase-flip transformer mode exhibit reduced hallucination frequency and improved long-range coherence.  
2. Output-coherence sensors reduce error accumulation during multi-step reasoning tasks.  
3. Attention rebalancers show human-like correction curves, stabilizing within 3–5 tokens when misled.  
4. Micro-buoyancy context managers reduce perplexity drift and style resets in long outputs (>10k tokens).  
5. Modular agent systems adopting Harmony feedback loops exhibit cross-agent stabilization analogous to cross-system biological coupling.
